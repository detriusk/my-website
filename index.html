      <!--Using entities here to emphasis words like difficult and technichal skills etc. to show whats important here-->
      <p>
        This game is very <em>difficult</em> for new comers looking to play the
        game, espcially if players aren't practicing their
        <strong>technical skills and knowledge</strong> of the game on a daily
        basis.Players who do tend to play the game more, while focusing on
        getting better, tend to raise their skill level and climb thier way up
        the ranks. Still not convinced? check out
        <a href="fun.html">this</a> for more.

      <section>
        <div>
          <h1 id="first-priority">The First priority when starting</h1>
          <p>
            Even though it sounds simple or might be overlooked, the first thing
            someone must do to get better at anything new, is practice or
            repetition. Make sure you are spending time on the game playing
            starting off with the game mode <strong>Practice mode</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I recommend this mode first because it helps new players walk
            through all the different types of abilities and keybinds to use for
            certain actions on the game. Whether that's attack moves, how to
            unlock your screen, and summoner spells.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="second-priority">The Second priority when starting</h2>
          <p>
            The next step when you are feeling comfortable with keybinds and
            which button do certain actions, I want you to start playing the
            game mode <em>Aram</em>. This mode is a fun and casual mode perfect
            for those first jumping into the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recommend this mode next because evem though you do not
            <strong>OWN</strong> any champions yet at this point, this game mode
            allows you to play random champions and even allows you to roll 2
            times for another random champion if you would rather play another.
            This game mode is a 5v5 in a smaller map with one single lane but
            with the same concept of attacking the enemy's towers with the end
            goal of their Nexus while still defending yours.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Here is a little sneak peak into what Aram will look like:</p>
          <img src="imgs/aram map.jpeg" alt="Aram Map" />
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="list">
        <div>
          <h3 id="move-on">Ready to move on?</h3>
          <p>
            Once you are ready and comfortable with playing champions and using
            their abilities and summoner skills, lets move on to the game mode,
            <strong>Summoner's Rift</strong>(Normals/Ranked)
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The next impportant steps we are going to discuss now is the roles
          there are in Summoner's Rift
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Top Lane</li>
          <li>Jungle</li>
          <li>Mid Lane</li>
          <li>Attack Damage Carry(ADC/Bot Carry)</li>
          <li>Support(Bot Support)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Depending on the role you decide to play, tends to play into whether
          you are playing more of a tanky build like top lane or more damage
          heavy like mid laner or ADC.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here it is just a matter of finding the role you like and playing
          to your hearts content!

        <h4>
          <p>My Favorite League Pro's and will be yours soon!</p>
          <p>
            The All-Time Greatest League of Legends Player in <em>History</em>,
            T1 Faker!
          </p>
          <img src="imgs/faker102.jpeg" alt="Faker" />
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Faker has the MOST League Of Legends Worlds Championships with
            <strong>5</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The closed team in league to Faker in championships is Gen.G having
            2 worlds under their belt.
          </li>
          <li>Fakers Career spans from 2013-Present</li>
          <li>Record of W-896 L-440 with a Win rate of 67.1%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My next favorite behind Faker is one of his past teammates being Zeus
          who was part of winning Worlds with Faker <strong>2 times</strong>
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/zeus101.jpeg" alt="Zeus" />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Zeus came up from the T1 acadamy team before being called up to the
            main roster
          </li>
          <li>Zeus bursted onto the scene quicly winning his first 2 Worlds</li>
          <li>
            Zeus is known for being one of the <strong>Best</strong> Top Laners
            after his first year Pro
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        These are my favorite players of all time because I came across this
        game on their run in Worlds back in 2023 early November-mid December
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching these two absolutely dominate together along wtih their other
        teammates being, Oner(jougle), Guma(ADC), and Keria(Support) was a thing
        of beauty to witness.
